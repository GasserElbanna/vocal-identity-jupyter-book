# # Pipeline

# To facilitate the process of unraveling the black box of self-supervised speech models, a pipeline has been implemented. The pipeline is designed to process any audio dataset in a standardized manner, then, bifurcate to the kind of analysis needed for a specific dataset or a research question, as shown below.

# It is intended to ultimately provide an open-source tool for experimenting with any audio feature extractor model and investigate the underlying acoustic features being encoded by that model via exploiting the different types of analyses.
