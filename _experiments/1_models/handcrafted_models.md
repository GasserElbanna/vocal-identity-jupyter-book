# Handcrafted Models

In this section, we define the handcrafted feature extractors used in speaker identity experiments. The rationale behind utilizing such features, is to leverage their interpretability and compare their performance with data-driven features.

Handcrafted features have always been used as low-level input to neural network models such as *Spectrograms* or competitive baseline for data-driven features for comparison such as openSMILE features.

Accordingly, in this section, we will go through the different type of handcrafted audio representations and their were later used in the experiments.
