# Self-supervised Speech Models

Supervised learning has become a bottleneck for imporving the efficiency of AI systems.

It is impossible to label everything

Self-supervised learning is elicited from a proposed hypothesis advocating that the building block of human and animal intelligence is *common sense*. That being said, it has been argued that the main difference between human/animal intelligence and current deep learning models is *common sense*. Because of common sense, humans are capable of learning a new skill within hours of practice with minimal supervision while machines require a vast amount of data from humans to learn a new task.



or as Prof. LeCun phrased ["common sense is the dark matter of artificial intelligence"](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/self-supervised-learning-the-dark-matter-of-intelligence/).
